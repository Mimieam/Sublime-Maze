##What is it? 
A maze game to take a break from coding and lost your mind in a perfect* maze crafted for sublime text 3 :)

##Why?
One of my coworker told me to stop playing with my weird editor and i thought to myself 'why not actually play a game from within ST?'
And I started typing like an over excited monkey ^^

## Installation

Open a shell from your `Packages` directory and run the following cmd:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Mimieam/Sublime-Maze.git 
```

## Playing

To start the maze :

  Go to `Tool>Command Palette` and select `Maze Game: Start`
or use the shortcut `[SHIFT]+[ALT]+[M]`

## Future Improvement
 - add some coloring 
 - add maze generator (done)
 - persistent scoring 
 - timer 
 - things to pick up for extra points
 - multiplayer race mode... in a long distant future 


## Acknowledgments 
[jf8073](https://github.com/jf8073/sublime-snake) for confirming that making a game in ST was possible  
[Nate](http://natewm.com/blog/2012/01/python-recursive-maze-example/) for the simple maze generator 

###Thank you 
This is my first sublime plugin so I hope that you will find it entertaining during your break and then get back to some happy coding :)
Don't hesitate to contact me with feedbacks or ideas, Thanks
